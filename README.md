# Portfolio Optimizer

## Inspiration
Inspired by Blackrock's challenge during a Hackathon in Edinburgh, I wanted to build something that was related to finance and utilized an AI algorithm to optimize a problem.

## What it does
The user inputs stocks that they want to invest into and then the web application will calculate using genetic algorithm and Sharpe's ratio the optimal portfolio allocation that minimizes risk while maximizing profits.

## How I built it
This was built using python 3 and Flask to perform the analysis. I used yahoo finance data to get historical prices of stocks. The frontend was built using HTML with JavaScipt library Canvas.js to plot graphs and Bootstrap.

## How to run it
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
